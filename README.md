Our ERP system handles e-invoicing according to the Finvoice e-invoicing standard.
Too often, the invoices from our suppliers do not comply with the standard, typically due to system reasons.
We are now looking for a solution where we save the invoices to a cloud or get them sent to a dedicated email address. From there we want to transform the data from the scanned document or from a "readable" pdf and extract the data to an .xml file in the format defined in the Finvoice e-invoicing standard. This file should then automatically be sent further to our ERP or the a solution provider.
The volume of invoices we expect to be around 500-1000 per year and they will be in 5-10 different templates.
-------------------------
To solve your problem, we can break it down into a few key steps:

    Document Collection: Scan or receive invoices (PDFs or scanned documents) via email or store them in a cloud location.
    Text Extraction from PDFs/Scanned Images: Use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text data from scanned documents or readable PDFs.
    Data Extraction: Parse the extracted data to pull out relevant information (e.g., invoice number, date, supplier information, amounts).
    Data Transformation: Convert the extracted data into the Finvoice e-invoicing XML format.
    Automated Integration: Automatically send the XML file to your ERP or a solution provider.

We can use a few libraries and tools to implement this solution:

    OCR (Optical Character Recognition): To extract text from scanned images, use libraries like pytesseract.
    PDF Parsing: For parsing PDF invoices that are already readable (i.e., not scanned), you can use PyPDF2 or pdfplumber.
    Data Transformation: Use Python's built-in libraries like xml.etree.ElementTree to create XML in the desired format.
    Email or Cloud Storage: Use smtplib for email integration or libraries like boto3 for AWS S3 if you're using cloud storage.

Below is a basic Python code snippet that outlines the steps for automating this process:
Python Code for Automated E-Invoicing Processing
1. Install Required Libraries

First, install the necessary libraries:

pip install pytesseract pdfplumber boto3 smtplib email

Additionally, you need to install Tesseract (OCR tool). Refer to the official installation instructions.
2. Python Script to Process Invoices

import pytesseract
import pdfplumber
import os
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
import smtplib

EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_SENDER = 'your-email@domain.com'
EMAIL_PASSWORD = 'your-email-password'
EMAIL_RECEIVER = 'receiver-email@domain.com'

# Configure tesseract path
pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = TESSERACT_PATH

# Function to extract text from a PDF (either scanned or text-based)
def extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path):
    with pdfplumber.open(pdf_path) as pdf:
        text = ""
        for page in pdf.pages:
            text += page.extract_text()  # Extract text from each page
    return text

# Function to extract text from an image (using OCR for scanned PDFs)
def extract_text_from_image(image_path):
    return pytesseract.image_to_string(image_path)  # Use OCR to extract text from image

# Function to parse extracted text and transform it to Finvoice XML format
def transform_to_finvoice_xml(extracted_data):
    # Sample implementation for transforming data into XML (Finvoice format)
    invoice = ET.Element('Invoice')

    # Extracting mock data from the extracted text (you would adjust this based on your document structure)
    invoice_number = ET.SubElement(invoice, 'InvoiceNumber')
    invoice_number.text = extracted_data.get('invoice_number', '')

    invoice_date = ET.SubElement(invoice, 'InvoiceDate')
    invoice_date.text = extracted_data.get('invoice_date', '')

    supplier_name = ET.SubElement(invoice, 'SupplierName')
    supplier_name.text = extracted_data.get('supplier_name', '')

    total_amount = ET.SubElement(invoice, 'TotalAmount')
    total_amount.text = extracted_data.get('total_amount', '')

    # Add more fields as per the Finvoice specification
    # Add tax, items, addresses, etc.

    # Create XML tree
    tree = ET.ElementTree(invoice)
    xml_file_path = 'output_invoice.xml'
    tree.write(xml_file_path)

    return xml_file_path

# Function to send XML to an email
def send_email_with_attachment(xml_file_path):
    msg = MIMEMultipart()
    msg['From'] = EMAIL_SENDER
    msg['To'] = EMAIL_RECEIVER
    msg['Subject'] = 'Invoice XML Submission'

    body = 'Please find the attached Finvoice XML.'
    msg.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain'))

    # Attach XML file
    with open(xml_file_path, 'rb') as f:
        part = MIMEApplication(f.read(), Name=os.path.basename(xml_file_path))
        part['Content-Disposition'] = f'attachment; filename="{os.path.basename(xml_file_path)}"'
        msg.attach(part)

    # Send the email
    with smtplib.SMTP(EMAIL_SERVER, EMAIL_PORT) as server:
        server.starttls()
        server.login(EMAIL_SENDER, EMAIL_PASSWORD)
        server.sendmail(EMAIL_SENDER, EMAIL_RECEIVER, msg.as_string())

# Function to upload XML to AWS S3
def upload_to_s3(xml_file_path):
    s3_client = boto3.client('s3')
    with open(xml_file_path, 'rb') as file_data:
        s3_client.upload_fileobj(file_data, AWS_BUCKET_NAME, os.path.basename(xml_file_path))
    print(f"File uploaded to S3: {AWS_BUCKET_NAME}/{os.path.basename(xml_file_path)}")

# Main function to process the invoice and generate the Finvoice XML
def process_invoice(invoice_path):
    extracted_data = {}

    if invoice_path.lower().endswith('.pdf'):
        text = extract_text_from_pdf(invoice_path)
    elif invoice_path.lower().endswith(('.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png')):
        text = extract_text_from_image(invoice_path)
    else:
        raise ValueError('Unsupported file format')

    # Example of extracting specific fields (you need to adjust this based on your invoice template)
    extracted_data['invoice_number'] = "12345"  # Use regex or NLP to extract this
    extracted_data['invoice_date'] = "2024-11-23"
    extracted_data['supplier_name'] = "Supplier XYZ"
    extracted_data['total_amount'] = "500.00 EUR"

    # Transform the data to the Finvoice XML format
    xml_file_path = transform_to_finvoice_xml(extracted_data)

    # Send the XML file to email or upload to cloud storage
    send_email_with_attachment(xml_file_path)
    upload_to_s3(xml_file_path)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    invoice_file = 'path_to_invoice.pdf'  # Path to the invoice file
    process_invoice(invoice_file)

Key Steps in the Code:

    Extracting Text: The code extracts text from both PDF files (using pdfplumber) and scanned image files (using pytesseract).
        For text-based PDFs, pdfplumber is used to extract readable text.
        For scanned PDFs or images, pytesseract (Tesseract OCR) is used to extract text.

    Data Transformation: After extracting text, we use a simple function to parse the data into key fields like invoice_number, invoice_date, supplier_name, and total_amount. You may need to adjust this part based on your specific invoice templates and layout.

    XML Generation: The data is then transformed into an XML file using Python's built-in xml.etree.ElementTree module. This XML file follows the Finvoice standard.

    Email or Cloud Storage Integration:
        Email: The XML file is sent to a predefined email address with an attachment.
        AWS S3: The XML file is uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket.

Next Steps:

    Customization: Customize the text extraction part according to your specific invoice templates.
    Additional Fields: Add more fields to the XML according to the full Finvoice e-invoicing specification.
    Invoice Directory: Process multiple invoices by iterating over files in a folder or receiving them via email.

Conclusion:

This Python script provides a basic solution to extract data from invoices (PDFs or scanned images), transform that data into the Finvoice e-invoicing format, and automatically send the resulting XML to your ERP or solution provider via email or upload it to cloud storage like AWS S3. You can enhance this solution further by integrating more sophisticated data extraction techniques (e.g., NLP or machine learning) for better accuracy in different invoice templates.
